         ii) There is no legal basis for KPISOFT processing your Personal Data and you demand that KPISOFT restricts your Personal Data from further processing.<br>

         iii) KPISOFT no longer requires your Personal Data but you claim that you require KPISOFT to retain such data in order to claim or exercise legal rights or to defend against third-party claims or<br>

         iv) In case you object to the processing of your Personal Data by KPISOFT (based on KPISOFT’s legitimate interest as further set out in B. below) for as long as it is required to review as to whether KPISOFT has a prevailing interest or legal obligation in processing your Personal Data.
